# information
Demo that I gave with the Conj talk 2012.

## Usage

As per usual.  However its a little ahead of clatrix master so you need to use my version from https://github.com/ejackson/clatrix currently.  Probably that'll not be the case for long.

## License
Distributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.
